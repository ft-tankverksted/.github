Hello, I'm leTanque!

I'm a software engineer who enjoys making music, working with my hands, and writing stable documented code.

Some of the "codes" I live by:
- Read the docs.
- Smooth is slow, slow is fast.
- You can save a week of planning by spending 3 weeks in additional development time.
- Understand the problem, Plan solution(s), Execute, Reflect. UPER.
- Write code for humans, not machines.
- Don't hesistate to communicate.
- Take ownership 
- build the future we need.
